### What is redux ?
Redux is a predictable state management library commonly used with JavaScript and popular frameworks like React. It provides a centralized container called the "store" to manage the application's state in a predictable and organized manner. Redux follows the principles of a Flux architecture, which emphasizes a unidirectional data flow.

The key concepts in Redux are as follows:

1. Store: The store is a JavaScript object that holds the application's state. It is the single source of truth for the entire application.

2. Actions: Actions are plain JavaScript objects that represent events or intentions to change the state. They must have a `type` property to indicate the type of action being performed.

3. Reducers: Reducers are pure functions that define how the state should be updated in response to actions. They take the current state and an action as parameters and return a new state. Reducers should not mutate the existing state but create a new state object.

4. Dispatch: Dispatch is a function provided by Redux to send actions to the store. When an action is dispatched, Redux passes it to the reducers, which then update the state accordingly.

5. Subscriptions: Components can subscribe to the store to receive updates whenever the state changes. This allows components to access the relevant parts of the state they need.

The Redux workflow typically involves the following steps:

1. Define Actions: Declare action types and create action creators, which are functions that return action objects.

2. Define Reducers: Write pure reducer functions that handle the state changes based on the dispatched actions.

3. Create Store: Set up the Redux store using the `createStore` function from Redux. Provide the root reducer function that combines all the reducers.

4. Dispatch Actions: Dispatch actions using the `dispatch` method. Reducers will process these actions and update the state accordingly.

5. Access State: Components can access the state by subscribing to the store. They receive updates when the relevant parts of the state change.

Redux helps manage complex state logic, provides a clear separation of concerns, and facilitates debugging and time-travel debugging with tools like Redux DevTools. It has gained popularity in the React ecosystem and has been widely adopted by developers for state management in JavaScript applications.


### How it is different from context API ?
Redux is a state management library commonly used in JavaScript and React applications. It provides a predictable state container for managing the application's data and state changes in a more organized and scalable way. Redux follows the principles of a Flux architecture, where the application state is stored in a single source of truth called the "store." The store is immutable, meaning that it cannot be directly modified. Instead, state changes are performed by dispatching actions, which are plain JavaScript objects describing the type of change to be made.

Reducers are pure functions responsible for handling the actions and producing a new state based on the current state and the action dispatched. These reducers are combined to form the application's overall reducer, which updates the store accordingly. Components can subscribe to the store and receive updates whenever the state changes, allowing them to access the data they need.

On the other hand, the Context API is a feature provided by React that allows components to share data without passing it through multiple levels of component hierarchy manually. It provides a way to create a "context" object that can be accessed by components nested within a provider component. The provider component sets the value of the context, and the consumer components can access that value.

While both Redux and the Context API can be used for state management in React applications, they have some differences:

Complexity: Redux is designed to handle complex state management scenarios with a clear separation of concerns. It enforces a unidirectional data flow and provides additional concepts like middleware and selectors. The Context API, on the other hand, is simpler and more lightweight, suitable for smaller applications with simpler state requirements.

Scalability: Redux is well-suited for large-scale applications where the state management needs to be highly organized and maintainable. It provides a centralized store and encourages immutable updates, making it easier to track changes and debug issues. The Context API works well for smaller applications, but as the application grows, managing the state in a centralized store like Redux can be more efficient and maintainable.

Performance: Redux performs well in scenarios where multiple components need access to the same data, as it prevents unnecessary re-renders by using shallow equality checks. The Context API can suffer from performance issues if the context value changes frequently, as it can lead to unnecessary re-renders of components that consume that context.

In summary, Redux is a more robust and feature-rich state management library, while the Context API is a simpler solution provided by React itself. The choice between them depends on the complexity of the application and the specific state management requirements.

### What are actions in redux ?
Declare action types and create action creators, which are functions that return action objects.



### What is useSelector and useDispatch in react redux
#useSelector: 
We can read data from the store with useSelector

#useDispatch:
we can dispatch the action with useDispatch
